# SemanticPage
In this task, I have tried to stick to the philosophy of BEM avoided selectors outside of classes, reduced investments. And I try to make as much as possible independent blocks. Used to modify the block name Nicholas Gallagher.

I added blocks compared with TASK to try BEM and train in the semantics.
